# Graph Theory
From google maps to our computer file tree, graphs are everywhere. This repository's goal is to demonstarte the implementations of popular algorithms in simplest and elegant way.

## Programming language
This repository is build upon JavaScript, and feel free to implement same in other programming languages.

# Running an Implementation
Node JS is the preferable option, download and install from Node's official website. [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Executing using Node JS
First using command line cd over to the directory containing these algorithms.
```
node ./dungeon-2d.js
```
